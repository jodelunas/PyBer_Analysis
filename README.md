# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was find the differences in the data by city type. First I created a summary data frame with the ride sharing data by city type. I then created a line chart to show the weekly fares by city type.

## Results
The data revealed the differences in total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. The results are shown below and in the attached data frame and graph.

### Rural
  - Total Rides: 125
  - Total Drivers: 78
  - Total Fares: $4,327.93
  - Average Fare per Ride: $34.62
  - Average Fare per Driver: $ 55.49
  
### Suburban
  - Total Rides: 625
  - Total Drivers: 490
  - Total Fares: $19,356.33
  - Average Fare per Ride: $30.97
  - Average Fare per Driver: $39.50
  
### Urban
  - Total Rides: 1,625
  - Total Drivers: 2,405
  - Total Fares: $39,854.38
  - Average Fare per Ride: $24.53
  - Average Fare per Driver: $16.57

From the data you can see that the urban city type had the most rides and drivers. It also had the most total fares, but the lowest average fares. The urban city type results were followed by suburban, and then rural.

## Summary
There is very little that can be done to address the diparities among the city types, because of demand and distance of rides. Urban settings have far more people that depend on ride sharing, and their rides are shorter distances than the suburban and rural riders. A few things could be done to increase interest for suburban and rural people, which could cause a need for more drivers and possibly lower the cost. You could do some research on popular places for these comunities to travel, such as the airport. You could offer an almost shuttle like service for these destinations. If people could share the cost for these services, they might find this is better than driving themselves and leaving their car in the parking garage. This would require a little advertising, but then word of mouth would do the rest. You could also offer specials for "Night in the City" outings, which might get people interested. Another way to get more people to use ride share would be to contact local bars to have them use your service when they feel like someone needs a ride home. Finally, there are people who need regular rides to doctors or work, and could be offered a monthly rate as opposed to a per ride basis. All of these things could possibly increase the amount of riders, which would increase the number of drivers, and lower the cost.
